This repository holds open source SymbolSource projects.


## SymbolSource.Server.Basic

The Gateway and Server.Basic projects hold the implementation of a symbol and source server equivalent to NuGet.Server. A simple, zeroconf solution for everyone to use. It's also available as [NuGet package](http://nuget.org/packages/SymbolSource.Server.Basic), ready to install into an empty MVC 3 project.

### Installing

## SymbolSource.Integration.NuGet.PackageExplorer
This is the NuGet Package Explorer plugin for validating symbol packages


## SymbolSource.Integration.NuGet.CommandLine
This could one day integrate symbol package validation into nuget.exe, but is only a stub at the moment.


## SymbolSource.Processing.Uninternalizer

This is a fun C# source code converter that uses NRefactory to change all protected and internal members into public ones. We use it to publish SymbolSource.Microsoft.Cci.Metadata.
